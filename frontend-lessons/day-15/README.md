**<h1 align="center">DAY 15: LOOPS</h1>**

**Loops** are like instructions for doing something repeatedly. Imagine you have a jar of cookies, and you want to eat them one by one. Instead of picking up each cookie and eating it separately, you might use a loop to make it easier.

*Here's how loops work in simple terms:*

## **FOR LOOP**

**For Loop**: This is like counting. You say, "I want to eat five cookies," and you count from 1 to 5 while eating a cookie each time.

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  // Do something (eat a cookie).
}
```

## **WHILE LOOP**

**While Loop**: This is like saying, "I'll keep eating cookies until the jar is empty." You don't know how many cookies are there; you just keep eating until you're done.

```js
while (jarNotEmpty) {
  // Do something (eat a cookie).
}
```

## **ARRAY LOOP**

**Array Loop**: If you have a bunch of cookies in a row (an array), you can use a loop to eat each one in order.

```js
const cookies = ["chocolate", "oatmeal", "sugar", "peanut butter"];

for (let i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
  // Do something (eat a cookie).
  console.log("Eating a " + cookies[i] + " cookie.");
}
```

Loops help you avoid doing the same thing over and over again, making your life easier when you have a lot of cookies (or tasks) to deal with.

> ***And that's how loops work in JavaScript**! They help you perform tasks repeatedly, just like eating your cookies one by one.*

## **JavaScript Fundamentals - Day 15: Assignment**

### **Submission Guidelines:**
1. Read the assignment instructions in the index.js file and organize your code and files neatly in the [javascript-tasks/day-15](../javascript-tasks/day-15/) folder.
2. Make sure to save it into your own repository. **ALL** tasks will be evaluated after the submission deadline in order to claim your certificate.
