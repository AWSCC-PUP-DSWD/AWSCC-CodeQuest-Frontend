**<h1 align=center> Final Project: Number Guessing Game </h1>**

***HEY THERE PARTNER! YOU'VE ALMOST COMPLETED THE 30 DAYS OF FRONTEND CHALLENGE! ðŸŽ‰***


The Number Game project provides a starting point with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** files, and your goal as a beginner is to ***implement the game logic in script.js***. This involves handling user input for guessing a random number and providing feedback until the correct guess is made. It's a great opportunity to reinforce JavaScript skills through practical application, covering concepts like **user input, conditionals, and loops** within the context of a simple and engaging number guessing game. Customize and expand the code to add personal touches or extra features for an enjoyable and educational learning experience.
