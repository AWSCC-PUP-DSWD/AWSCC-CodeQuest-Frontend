// JavaScript Fundamentals - Day 14: Assignment

// 1. Create a variable named `temperature` and assign it a value.
// 2. Use an `if` statement to check if the `temperature` is greater than 30. Print a message to the console accordingly.
// 3. Extend the previous example with an `else` statement to print a different message if the temperature is not greater than 30.
// 4. Create a variable named `time` and assign it a value representing the current hour (in 24-hour format).
// 5. Use `else if` statements to greet the user based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening).
// 6. Create a switch statement for the variable `day`. Print a message based on the day of the week.
