// Step 1: Define the choices available in the game
const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];

// Step 2: Get references to HTML elements
const player1ChoiceDisplay = // Get the element with the id of "player1-choice-display"
const player1ScoreDisplay = // Get the element with the id of "player1-score"
const player2ChoiceDisplay = // Get the element with the id of "player2-choice-display"
const player2ScoreDisplay = // Get the element with the id of "player2-score"

const gameStatusDisplay = // Get the element with the id of "game-status"
const resetGameButton = // Get the element with the id of "reset-game-btn"

const rockBtn = // Get the element with the id of "rock-btn"
const paperBtn = // Get the element with the id of "paper-btn"
const scissorsBtn = // Get the element with the id of "scissors-btn"

// Step 3: Add event listeners to the buttons
rockBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {

});

paperBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {

});

scissorsBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {

});

resetGameButton.addEventListener("click", function () { 
    
});

// Step 4: Define helper functions that will be the actions of the game
